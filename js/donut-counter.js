//JS Donut Counter Lab

//declare 2 variables one for guests and one for donuts

var guests = parseInt(prompt("How many guests do you have?"))
var donuts = parseInt(prompt("How many donuts do you have?"))

if (donuts < guests) {
  alert("There are" + donuts "and" + guests + ". Buy more donuts!!!")

}
//use prompt method to bring up a dialog box in the browser for the user to insert the number of guests and donuts.
//use parseInt to convert the users answer from a string to an integer.



//write a conditional to check if there are enough donuts

  //alert the user with a message telling them the numbers of donuts and guests, and if there are enough donuts for each guest.
